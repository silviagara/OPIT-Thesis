# Governable HR Chatbot — Low-Code AI Case Study

## Overview
This project presents the design and evaluation of a **governable, low-code conversational AI system**
developed in collaboration with an Italian fintech company (HR domain).

The goal was to transform static HR documentation into a **trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready AI assistant**.

## Business Context
- Company size: ~210 employees
- HR team: 2 people
- Main challenge: high volume of repetitive HR questions (60–70% of HR time)

## Key Design Principles
- Governability over model power
- Deterministic behavior via Classic Orchestration
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation grounded in verified documentation
- Low-code architecture aligned with business ownership

## System Architecture (High-Level)
- Curated HR Knowledge Base (45 documents)
- 22 topic-based sub-agents
- Intent-based routing
- Validated retrieval + controlled response generation

## Evaluation & Results
- 336 behavioral tests
- 99% full accuracy
- 0 hallucinations
- Response time reduced from 24–48h to <2s
- Estimated ~70% reduction in repetitive HR workload

## Post-Launch Insights
- ~85 real user requests handled in first month
- Mostly correct responses, positive HR feedback
- Identified next steps: analytics, monitoring, KB maintenance

## Key Takeaway
Reliable AI systems don’t emerge from complexity,
but from **structure, constraints, and disciplined design**.
